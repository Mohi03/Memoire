Follow these guidelines: 1. Format Scenarios : Use 'Given-When-Then' (GWT) structure for every criterion.  2. Include:    - Functional requirements.    - Edge cases (invalid inputs, errors, timeouts).    - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, UX) if applicable.  3. Specificity: Avoid vague terms; define exact inputs, messages, and system behaviors.  4. Atomicity: Each criterion should be independently testable.  5. User Perspective: Focus on user actions and observable outcomes.  answer me directly and only with the secanrios and write only the acceptnace critreria and dont write back the user stroy"),

    *   When I enter a password and a confirmation password that do not match
    *   Then an error message should be displayed indicating the passwords do not match, and the account creation should fail.
